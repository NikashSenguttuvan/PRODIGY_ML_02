# Retail Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering<br>
This repository hosts the implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm used to segment customers of a retail store according to their purchase history. This project aims to identify distinct groups within the customer base to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement effectively.<br>

Project Overview:<br>
Objective: To leverage customer purchase data to find meaningful customer segments using the k-means clustering algorithm.<br>
Data: The dataset includes various features such as total purchase amount, frequency of purchase, product categories purchased, and other relevant customer data.<br>
Methodology: We utilize the k-means clustering technique, a part of unsupervised machine learning, to analyze and categorize customers into clusters based on similarities in their purchasing behavior.<br>
Features:<br>
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for the clustering process.<br>
Feature Engineering: Crafting features that effectively capture customer behaviors and trends.<br>
K-Means Clustering: Implementation of the k-means algorithm to discover customer groups.<br>
Optimal Cluster Determination: Using methods like the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.<br>
Visualization: Plotting clusters and interpreting results with visual aids such as scatter plots and bar charts.<br>
Insights and Analysis: Detailed analysis of each cluster to provide insights into customer behavior.<br>
Tools and Technologies:<br>
Python: Primary programming language.<br>
Scikit-Learn: For implementing the k-means clustering algorithm.<br>
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.<br>
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.<br>
How to Use:<br>
